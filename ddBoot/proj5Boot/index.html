        <p>As the world of <span class="highlight">business relies 		on the Internet</span> more and more, <span class="highlight">web-related career 		
        opportunities are growing</span>.  Web skills are needed in public companies, 
        private companies, non-profit organizations, local, state and federal government 
        agencies, schools, and any other kind of business or organization that you can 
        think of.  It is also a career that can be part-time, full-time, free-lance and 
        home-based, creating many <span class="highlight">flexible job opportunities</span>.</p>

                	<h2>Design vs Development column 1</h2>

					<p>Depending on the size of the organization, job descriptions for 	
                    web-based careers may include experts in graphic design, content 	
                    creation, programming, and usability testing. In smaller 
                    organizations, the web designer and the web developer may be the only 
                    employees working on web projects. Most web designers are more 
                    marketable if they have at least some knowledge of web coding. Most 
                    web developers are more marketable if they have some knowledge of the 
                    importance of design and how the site looks. Students interested in a 
                    web career should accumulate skills in both areas whenever possible.</p>

        			<h2>Web Designer column 2</h2>

					<p>The education and training requirements to be a web designer vary 
                    significantly depending on the size and type of organization and the 
                    sophistication of that organization's use of the web.  When reading 
                    job listings, common technical skills listed include:</p>

					<ul>
 						<li>Knowledge of HTML, XHTML, CSS coding</li>
  						<li>Knowledge of tools like Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Adobe 
                        Illustrator</li>
  						<li>Knowledge of color theory and composition and visual design 
                        skills</li>

                	<h2>Web Developers column 3</h2>

					<p>A web developer works more on the server side development, web 
                    server configuration, and web server security.  Most developers build 
                    a foundation in programming abilities to enable them to learn to 
                    program in any language.  Programming languages and web development 
                    tools often mentioned in job listings include: Perl, C,  Ajax, Python, 					Ruby and scripting.  Knowing how to build a database and use it on the 					web is also an asset to a developer's resume.</p>

					<p>Any job in the area of web design and development will require 
                    continuous study because of the rapidly changing nature of the 
                    Internet and web technology.  Ongoing education in current technology 
                    is necessary.</p>
